# Getting Started

So you have a project in mind, and it requires collecting data using mobile phones. Or maybe you already started collecting data, but your pen and paper method is showing its limits. And on top of that, your experience of mobile data collection is close to zero. Have no fear! You’ve arrived at the right place.  

The spread of cheap smartphones, which started during the 2010s, allowed the potential of mobile data collection to be unlocked. A multitude of projects, from urban mapping to the surveying of remote communities, dropped their previous cumbersome methods (pen and paper, specialised suite of hardware tools…) to switch to collecting data using the now-ubiquitous smartphone.  

But a tool can only do so much. Correctly collecting data in general requires a mix of knowledge and skills that no smartphone will replace. And if your project is of any significant size,creating an interdisciplinary team with the right mix of skills will be vital to its smooth and successful execution.  

But before detailing the role of each team member, let's review the when, where and how of collecting data.  

## When, Where and How

Obviously, you can only collect data to which you have access. The first part of defining a data collection strategy is understanding when or where will the act of data collection will take place.  

WHEN applies to something that goes through different steps of a chain: for example, a fish is first caught on a fishing boat, then brought to a harbour, sent to a storage room etc.  
WHERE applies to the location where you might have to go to do the data collection: you will not be able to bring the same equipment on a boat or in a office building.  

Once you have your answer, you need to define HOW you will collect the data. It could be :
 - using one or several existing database(s),
 - using forms, questionnaires and interviews,
 - using direct observations.  

Direct observations is making direct measurements of the subject being studied (like the number of buildings in need of repair after an earthquake), rather than using indirect measurements, such as databases or testimonies from people knowledgeable in the field. Most often, direct observations are made by human observers, sometimes with the aid of specific equipment: 
pollution sensors to measure air pollution, 
Geiger counters to measure radioactivity,
smartphones to record visual observations and, potentially, sound.  

As you may have guessed, this guide will focus on direct observations using smartphones to collect data. Any additional or process-specific content available can be found on the dedicated website, in the +RESOURCES section.

## Setting up your team

Collecting data using smartphones has many advantages in terms of ease-of-use and cost- reduction, especially over the paper based method:
 - they are available in sparsely populated areas, which means that the act of collecting data can be, if needed, crowdsourced by people living in the field;
 - they often feature at least a basic camera and sound recorder, which allows for multimedia data collection; 
 - the results of the data collection can be sent in real time, provided an internet connection is available.  

But there are many ways in which smartphone data-collection can go wrong, making the whole process costlier and more difficult than it should be! This is why a dedicated preparation phase is vital.  

To give you the best overview of the tasks involved in collecting data, we’ve divided them into the four key roles that feature in a data collection team. These functions aren’t rigid, of course: your team members may be able to cover multiple roles or there may be a sub-team focused on a particular area. Your choice of resource allocation should encompass the level of expertise of each member, the scope of the project, and the budget available.
