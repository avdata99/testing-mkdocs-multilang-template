# I am the... Survey Designer

## Introduction to the role

*“My mission is to construct questions that elicit just the right data from the survey’s respondents. I have to make sure questions are not ambiguous and are as straightforward as possible, encompassing complexity and subtleties in a way the respondents fully understand. My role also has a large visual design element: I ensure the survey looks appealing and is engaging to complete.”*  

## Timeline of the tasks

### BEFORE

I examine the research design and project plan and identify the key information the survey needs to cover.  

I begin drafting the different fields that will need to be filled, or questions that will need to be answered.  

I design the survey for smartphones, making sure it is fully functional for the platform.  

In collaboration with the rest of the team, I assess the quality of the survey questions during the pilot study.  

### DURING

In collaboration with the rest of the team, I provide support to the enumerators in the field, as necessary

#### Best practices

Questions: the fewer, the better  
If the survey requires interviewing people, a good number of questions is 10 or below. Similarly, the more fields enumerators have to fill, the more errors they will tend to make.  

Be practical  
The survey should be designed with the phone screen(s) it will be read on in mind. Because the screen estate is often very small, superfluous elements such as graphics, having the title on every page, the progress bar etc should be avoided. One question per page is a good idea.  

Optimise the user experience  
To avoid errors and allow enumerators to focus on one question at a time, a sequential, single question display should be used. The previous/next buttons should be obvious and visible. Lastly, answer confirmations help avoid mistyping.  

Make sure that the logic of your survey is sound  
Testing your survey beforehand allows you to make sure that mandatory fields can not be skipped, that the survey reacts correctly when incorrect data is entered and that the pre-filled fields display the correct information.  

Include a post-completion review  
Wherever possible, the errors in data entry should be corrected in the field, when the context of the error is still there. Good practice is then to allow a review of answers before sending data to the server.
