# I am the... Project Manager

## Introduction to the role
*“I am responsible for overall management of the survey. I define the project goal and I’m responsible for all the major decisions that need to be taken during the project. I’m also responsible for communication amongst the survey team, to make sure that everybody is on the same page. I report the project status, maintain a record of lessons learned and lead retrospectives.”*  

## Timeline of the tasks

### BEFORE

I design the project along with the other stakeholders: this involves deciding on a clear goal (the objective), identifying a question that the project will seek to answer, and defining the requisite data to be collected. Example: What is the state of Kathmandu buildings after the earthquake?  

I write down the work plan, which details the necessary steps of the data collection project, their sequence and their coordination.  

I budget the project. Mobile data collection projects have particular costs that need to be considered (hardware, data transmission, data aggregation, software maintenance) along with more general costs (insurance, personnel...).  

I identify the best device for the survey: smartphone vs tablet? Battery-life needed?  

I make sure that the training is properly conducted and that enumerators are sufficiently skilled to carry out the data collection.  

### DURING
I ensure that enumerators are actively collecting data and communicate  progress to stakeholders, as appropriate.  

### AFTER
I supervise the analysis of the data.  

I consolidate the results in a report that is presented to the stakeholders.  

#### Best practices

Be clear on the goal  
Throughout the project you will need to take major decisions and being clear on  your goal throughout will help you with this, as well as saving time in the project’s later stages.  

Define a project workflow and protocol  
This serves two purposes: it ensures that all your stakeholders are on the same page, that they have similar expectations as regards the expected rate of progress. Secondly, it streamlines the reporting part of your role: everyone knows what to expect and when.  

Pick the right device for your data collection needs  
There are lots of mobile devices on the market and choosing the right one can be difficult.  You’ll need to consider points such as smartphone vs. tablet, battery life, GPS accuracy, camera and app compatibility.  

Provide different options for uploading data  
If your survey requires media inputs, data uploads might cause concerns around cost (data charges) and logistics (limited coverage of phone carriers). One approach, available in software like KLL Collect, is to upload the data right away, then only later submit the media attachments. Another one is to use swappable memory cards and assigning a runner to collect them for later upload.  

#### Have a Plan B

Things won’t always go as planned, so you’ll need to have a contingency plan for everything: what if a device stops working? What happens if a server goes down? What if the GPS doesn’t work as expected? Is there a process for backing up the data?  

Make sure that a mobile data collection process is the right choice  
Mobile data collection might not always be the best idea. Sometimes paper-based survey or web based survey makes more sense than using mobile based data collection. This is the case for small surveys with low data entry cost where real-time updates are not necessary or data collection projects where mobility and internet connection are not an issue.
