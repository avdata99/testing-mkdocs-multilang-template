# I am the... Trainer

## Introduction to the role

*“I run the training sessions that will help interviewers, or enumerators, learn the skills they need to perform a successful data collection with participants. Even if the survey is well designed, the quality of the data collected through the interviews depends ultimately on the data collection skills of the enumerators. I make sure they get acquainted with the mobile devices and the mobile app used to conduct the survey.”*  

## Timeline of the tasks

### BEFORE

I get to know the survey, the mobile devices and the potential difficulties that enumerators might face on the field.  

I plan and organise one or more training sessions for enumerators, pre-empting all potential difficulties.  

I work with the survey designer and data manager on the pilot study to help flag mistakes done by enumerators.  

### DURING

In collaboration with the rest of the team, I provide support to the enumerators in the field, as necessary.  

#### Best practices

Vary the teaching formats  
The training should include demonstrations, hands-on and Q&A sessions, ideally spread over a few days. Additionally, there should be sessions on core survey content, damage assessment training, proper utilization of fields guides, etc.  

#### Supervise the pilot study

At the end of the training, having a trainer supervising the pilot study is very useful to help clear out any doubt enumerators might have and identify the points which might need further training.  

#### Don’t assume anything
The training should cover everything, from an explanation of the context of the survey to the way to take useful photos, to details of the mobile device’s features: GPS, Auto-Rotate, System Date and Time…you generally can’t predict with what your enumerators will be familiar.  

#### Leave room for questions and feedback
Paper copies of the survey may be useful in the first instance, so that enumerators can annotate and make comments on the fields or questions of the survey. Encourage everybody to ask questions, even if they fear that the question could be stupid!  

#### Prepare enumerators for the worst
It’s almost inevitable that something will malfunction during the survey. Enumerators should be able to reset or reinstall problematic software.
